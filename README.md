# Audio Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to classify urban sounds from the [UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) dataset. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately categorize audio clips into ten distinct classes: air conditioner, car horn, children playing, dog bark, drilling, engine idling, gunshot, jackhammer, siren, and street music. The project demonstrates the potential of audio classification for practical applications such as environmental monitoring, smart city development, and enhancing accessibility technologies.

## Dataset

The [UrbanSound8K dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) contains 8,732 labeled audio files organized into ten classes of urban sounds. Each audio clip has a maximum duration of four seconds and includes metadata that provides the class label and file path. This dataset is widely used for research in environmental sound classification and offers a rich variety of sounds captured in urban settings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: 
  - Analyze the dataset to understand class distribution and characteristics.
  - Visualize audio waveforms and spectrograms to gain insights into the spectral features of different sound classes.

- **Feature Extraction**: 
  - Extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from each audio clip, which effectively capture the audio signal's spectral features. MFCCs are widely used in audio processing for their ability to represent the power spectrum of a sound.

- **Model Building**: 
  - Construct a fully connected feedforward neural network using Keras. The model is designed to learn from the MFCC features and classify audio samples accurately.
  - Use techniques such as dropout for regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

- **Model Evaluation**: 
  - Evaluate the model's performance using a test dataset, measuring accuracy and other metrics to assess its ability to classify unseen audio samples.
